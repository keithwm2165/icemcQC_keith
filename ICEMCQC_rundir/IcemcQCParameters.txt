#NOTES ON PARAMETERS:

#MODE
#This field MUST be 'AUTOMATIC' or 'MANUAL'  (in lower case letters).
#AUTOMATIC- downloads all updates to Icemc or installs 
#latest versions in RUNDIR/update/, then runs IcemcQC 
#on any updated trunks and/or releases
#MANUAL - runs IcemcQC on the version of Icemc installed 
#in the RUNDIR directory

#RUNDIR
#Do NOT include a name.number here (ie, do NOT include 
#hendricks.189)
#This should be the path from your home directory ( ~ ) to 
#the directory from which you want to use IcemcQC.  If you 
#are using AUTOMATIC MODE, #IcemcQC will update/install 
#Icemc to this directory under RUNDIR/update/.  If you are 
#using MANUAL MODE, this should be the path of the directory 
#that contains the version of Icemc you want to run 
#IcemcQC on. 

#TGTDIR
#This should be the path from your home to the directory 
#where you want to store the final plots, outputs, and 
#other products.  Do NOT include a name.number here

#SVNUSER
#This is your Icemc svn user, NOT your OSU last name + dot 

#SETUP FILES
#DO NOT USE "." in the setup file name except for the extension!
#You MUST use the . t x t extension (no spaces) as that is what 
#IcemcQC is looking for. 

#PLOTTING FILES
#Include the *. cc or *. c extension (no spaces).

#DWELL
#This is the amount of time IcemcQC waits between checks to see 
#if jobs are done.
